## Grid Scaler

## Compatibility

Requires FVTT version 0.1.0 or higher

To install a module, follow these instructions:

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the included folder to `public/modules` in your Foundry Virtual Tabletop installation folder.
3. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop. 

## How to Use the plugin

Once the plugin is loaded a new icon will appear on the main tool selection called (Get Grid)

Make sure your maps current X/Y offset is set to 0 or this will not work right. (will check for this in the future and modify accordingly)

Click on this then select two points on your map (preferably two corners of a square).

This will then adjust the Grid Size along with the X/Y offset to try and match whats on your map.

It may not be perfect but I will be close. 

### Features in planning (maybe?)

1. Instead of clicking on two point, actually draw a square on the canvas then use that as reference points. Would make it easier for maps with no pre-existing grid lines.
2. Create a new Menu button which will put this tool and the following idea in their own space.
3. Create an X/Y adjustment button which will take a reference click and move the grid to the click in the requested axis.

## Notes and Mentions

This is my first foray into working with Javascript/HTML/jQuery/CSS. So its rough but I hope to polish it up. Any suggestions on code/cleanup/what can be done better just message me on discord!

### Big thanks to Atropos and Felix ( aka sly3r86 ) for their help and the code which was totally not butchered to make this.
